(A de minimis interest that would not “impair the employee’s ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the Government” is not covered under this definition.)\n\n(1) Among the sources of personal conflicts of interest are—\n\n(i) Financial interests of the covered employee, of close family members, or of other members of the covered employee’s household;\n\n(ii) Other employment or financial relationships (including seeking or negotiating for prospective employment or business); and\n\n(iii) Gifts, including travel.\n\n(2) For example, financial interests referred to in paragraph (1) of this definition may arise from—\n\n(i) Compensation, including wages, salaries, commissions, professional fees, or fees for business referrals;\n\n(ii) Consulting relationships (including commercial and professional consulting and service arrangements, scientific and technical advisory board memberships, or serving as an expert witness in litigation);\n\n(iii) Services provided in exchange for honorariums or travel expense reimbursements;\n\n(iv) Research funding or other forms of research support;\n\n(v) Investment in the form of stock or bond ownership or partnership interest (excluding diversified mutual fund investments);\n\n(vi) Real estate investments;\n\n(vii) Patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property interests; or\n\n(viii) Business ownership and investment interests."
