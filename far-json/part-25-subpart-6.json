L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) with regard to manufactured construction material and the 41 U.S.C. chapter 83, Buy American (referred to in this subpart as the Buy American statute) with regard to unmanufactured construction material.

(The Buy American statute applies.)\n\n(2) A manufactured construction material that is manufactured in the United States and, if the construction material consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel was produced in the United States. (Section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies.)\n\n“Foreign construction material” means a construction material other than a domestic construction material.\n\n“Manufactured construction material” means any construction material that is not unmanufactured construction material.\n\n“Public building or public work” means a building or work, the construction, prosecution, completion, or repair of which is carried on directly or indirectly by authority of, or with funds of, a Federal agency to serve the interest of the general public regardless of whether title thereof is in a Federal agency (see 22.401). These buildings and works may include, without limitation, bridges, dams, plants, highways, parkways, streets, subways, tunnels, sewers, mains, power lines, pumping stations, heavy generators, railways, airports, terminals, docks, piers, wharves, ways, lighthouses, buoys, jetties, breakwaters, levees, and canals, and the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of such buildings and works.\n\n“Recovery Act designated country” means a World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement country, a Free Trade Agreement country, or a least developed country.\n\n“Steel” means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between .02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements.\n\n“Unmanufactured construction material” means raw material brought to the construction site for incorporation into the building or work that has not been—\n\n(1) Processed into a specific form and shape; or\n\n(2) Combined with other raw material to create a material that has different properties than the properties of the individual raw materials."

This does not restrict the origin of the elements of the iron or steel, but requires that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives.\n\n(B) The requirement in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to iron or steel components or subcomponents in construction material that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel.\n\n(iii) All other components. There is no restriction on the origin or place of production or manufacture of components or subcomponents that do not consist of iron or steel.\n\n(iv) Examples.\n\n(A) If a steel guardrail consists predominantly of steel, even though coated with aluminum, then the steel would be subject to the section 1605 restriction requiring that all stages of production of the steel occur in the United States, in addition to the requirement to manufacture the guardrail in the United States. There would be no restrictions on the other components of the guardrail.\n\n(B) If a wooden window frame is delivered to the site as a single construction material, there is no restriction on any of the components, including the steel lock on the window frame; or\n\n(2) If trade agreements apply, the manufactured construction material shall either comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection, or be wholly the product of or be substantially transformed in a Recovery Act designated country;\n\n(b) Manufactured materials purchased directly by the Government and delivered to the site for incorporation into the project shall meet the same domestic source requirements as specified for manufactured construction material in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; and\n\n(c) A project may include several contracts, a single contract, or one or more line items on a contract."
