Avoid the use of acronyms or terminology that is not widely understood by the general public.\n\n(b) Regardless of dollar value, if the contract action, including all modifications and orders under task or delivery order contracts, is not both fixed-price and competitively awarded, publicize the award notice and include in the description the rationale for using other than a fixed-priced and/or competitive approach. Include in the description a statement specifically noting if the contract action was not awarded competitively, or was not fixed-price, or was neither competitive nor fixed-price. These notices and the rationale will be available to the public at the GPE, so do not include any proprietary information or information that would compromise national security. The following table provides examples for when a rationale is required.\n\nPosting of Rationale - Examples\n\n(c) Contracting officers shall use the instructions available in the Recovery FAQs under “Buyers/Engineers” at the GPE (https://www.fedbizopps.gov) to identify actions funded in whole or in part by the Recovery Act."
